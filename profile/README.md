# Blaze Streaming Media

Building cloud-native video pipelines for events that can't fail.

---

### Hey there! 👋

We're the team behind the scenes, engineering rock-solid video infrastructure for large-scale live events. Think global conferences, product keynotes, and major broadcasts. Our work is all about reliability, security, and scale, built on a foundation of **AWS** and **Infrastructure-as-Code**.

**What we do:**
- 🎬 Handle complex live streaming with 15–30+ simultaneous feeds.
- ⚙️ Spin up (and tear down) entire event pipelines with Terraform.
- 🌎 Integrate real-time captioning and multi-language translation.
- 🔐 Secure our streams with CloudFront, signed URLs, and custom authorizers.
- 📈 Keep a close eye on everything with a monitoring stack of Bitmovin, CloudWatch, and Grafana.

### Our Stack & Workflow

- 🌍 **Remote-First:** Our stream engineers are fully remote, coordinating closely with on-site production teams to make the magic happen.
- ☁️ **AWS Native:** We live and breathe AWS. Our core toolkit includes Elemental, MediaConnect, MediaLive, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and more.
- 🤖 **Automation is Key:** We use Terraform to treat our infrastructure as code. The fewer clicks the better.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Ops:** Airtable is our single source of truth for session metadata, channel schedules, and operational data.
